## Hi, I'm Max!

I graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 2023, where I studied software engineering. 
Currently, I'm a second year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, wher I study 
Computer Science. I have experience with full-stack development, web development, and have worked in 
Python, Java, C, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript.
